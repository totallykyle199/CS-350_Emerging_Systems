# Summary of Projects
The two projects that I felt I did the best on were the thermostat and morse code projects.

The Thermostat project involved creating a task scheduler that would use an ambient temperature sensor and compare it to a set temperature to control the heater. The heater is represented by an LED that would turn on if the heater was active and turn off when it was off. There are two buttons that raise or lower the set temperature, and the task scheduler would check if a button was pushed every 200ms and check the ambient temperature every 500ms. The code would also report the current temperature, target temperature, heater status, and seconds of runtime via Uart.

The Morse code project displayed morse code of short red LED for dot and Long Green LED for a dash. The code would show SOS in morse code on a loop and when a button was pushed it would finish displaying SOS first then switch to an OK message. When the button is preshed it would first make sure the current message finishes displaying before switching.

# What did I do well
Both of my project were able to work fully and completely and I believe I was able to plan out and work on my code in section effectivly. Both projects were somewhat complex and by breaking each project into sections and planning out my work before starting allowed me to finish my work on time and not become stuck on a section.

# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Taking this class made me learn a lot about embedded systems and new ways to code. I had no prior experience with embedded systems before this class and I found myself looking at a lot of different material to understand how these systems work.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills I learned from these projects is how to break down and plan out my work. I also have learned to understand the flow of the project and how code for an embedded system should be layed out.

# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To make the project maintainable and readable I followed best coding practices, this makes the code easy to read and follow. I also used state machines to control the function of the program making it easy to change the function of the program without changing a lot of code.
